Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of website or a web page in
search engine and provide a result on top search .Using SEO we can receive the higher ranked on
the search engine page and its more frequently a site appears in the search result list, the more
visitors it will receive from the search engine&#39;s users. In many respects it&#39;s simply quality control for
websites. Having said that, if there was ever an industry that was little understood by outsiders its
SEO

# Why does my website need SEO?

Majority of web traffic is driven by the major commercial search engines, Google, Bing, and Yahoo!
Although social media and other types of traffic can generate visits to your website, search engines
are the primary method of navigation for most Internet users. This is true whether your site provides
content, services, products, information, or just about anything else. Search engines are unique in
that they provide targeted traffic—people looking for what you offer. Search engines are the roadways
that make this happen. If search engines cannot find your site, or add your content to their databases,
you miss out on incredible opportunities to drive traffic to your site.
Search queries—the words that users type into the search box—carry extraordinary value.
Experience has shown that search engine traffic can make (or break) an organization&#39;s success.
Targeted traffic to a website can provide publicity, revenue, and exposure like no other channel of
marketing. Investing in SEO can have an exceptional rate of return compared to other types of
marketing and promotion.

#Why can&#39;t the search engines figure out my site without SEO?

Search engines are smart, but they still need help. The major engines are always working to improve
their technology to crawl the web more deeply and return better results to users. However, there is a
limit to how search engines can operate. Whereas the right SEO can net you thousands of visitors
and increased attention, the wrong moves can hide or bury your site deep in the search results where
visibility is minimal.
In addition to making content available to search engines, SEO also helps boost rankings so that

content will be placed where searchers will more readily find it. The Internet is becoming increasingly
competitive, and those companies who perform SEO will have a decided advantage in visitors

#Types of SEO:
As the colours of the types of search engine optimization suggest, there are stark differences in the
approach and long-term results of white hat and black hat search engine optimization. Though both
types of SEO have their proponents, most companies/websites with long-term, stable, and
sustainable goals will tend to stay away from the dark-collared variety.


1. White Hat SEO:
Some white hat SEO techniques include: high quality content development, website
HTML optimization and restructuring, link acquisition campaigns supported by high quality content
and manual research and outreach. White hat SEO utilizes techniques and methods to improve the
search engine rankings of a website which don&#39;t run afoul of search engine (mainly Google)
guidelines.


2. Black Hat SEO:
Some black hat SEO techniques include: link spam, keyword stuffing, cloaking,
hidden text, and hidden links. Black Hat SEO exploits weaknesses in the search engine algorithms to
obtain high rankings for a website. Such techniques and methods are in direct conflict with search
engine guidelines.
